Petty is a small PHP app (made with Laravel) that allows you to host your own URL shortener. It's clean and easy to use and install, allowing you to have your own shortener in a few minutes. 

For now it does not support statistics, that is made initially by Bitly. We're working on new features and in the future Petty will do all the job. Please contribute with the project and suggest new features.

## How it works

Petty shorts the original URL generating new URLs like `http://doma.in/m9`. This URL redirects you to Bitly shorten URL (to get statistics) and after to the original URL.

The app uses **your own domain**, and the generated URLs are customized for you. All generated URL are stored in a Sqlite database and generated using your Laravel `APP_KEY`, so using `http://doma.in/m9` as example, the `m9` is generated only for you, and represents a row stored in your local database.

## Installing

```
cd /home/username/petty
composer create-project jgrossi/petty .
```

Attention! Your web root (virtual host) will be `/home/username/petty/public`!

### Composer packages

Now you have to install Composer packages. This will install everything the app need to run.

```
composer install
```

By default all `css` and `js` files are stored in `public` folder minified and merged. If you want to customize your assets files, like changing `css` or even `js` I suggest to install `bower` packages and `elixir (gulp)`. This will take a little:

```
bower install
npm install
```

Bower will install Bootstrap, Clipboard.js, FontAwesome, jQuery and jQuery-UJS (by Ruby on Rails). NPM will install gulp and all elixir dependencies. 

## Configuration

All configuration is made using `.env`. You'll have a `.env.sample` file where you can change with your own data and after rename it to `.env`. That's it!

```
APP_ENV=local # Your app env
APP_DEBUG=true # Enabe or disable debug?
APP_KEY=8gboHDJkh2q80dRPFcy6y0X5PsaUVcKa # This key is generated when you install Petty

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_FILE="database.sqlite" # You can change this if you want

CACHE_DRIVER=file
SESSION_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_DRIVER=sync

# The domain you want to use, like http://doma.in
PETTY_DOMAIN="http://petty.dev"

# Minimum number of chars, like http://doma.in/m8 - the number 1 won't work
PETTY_SIZE=2 

# Your avatar image. By default we have set 2 avatars: `avatar-male.png` and `avatar-female.png` - Tranks to http://www.freepik.com. You can store your own image in `public` directory and link that, like `img/your-custom-avatar.png`;
PETTY_AVATAR="img/avatar-male.png"

# Your own name, like "Junior Grossi"
PETTY_NAME="Your Name" 

# Your Bitly username. If you don't have one just signup and get yours for free
PETTY_USERNAME="jgrossi" 

# Your Bitly password
PETTY_PASSWORD=secret  
```

### Running your own assets

After that you will have 3 more directories in your folder root: `vendor`, `bower_components` and `node_modules`. The original `css` and `js` files are stored in `resources/assets` folder.

Running `gulp watch --production` will allow you to change the `resources/assets/css/*.less` and `resources/assets/js/*.js` files. So, after that `gulp` will join everything and minify the result, storing them in `public/css/styles.css` and `public/js/scripts.js` respectively.
